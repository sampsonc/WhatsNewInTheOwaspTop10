BinaryFormatter and other serializers that don’t limit types should never accept
untrusted inputs as those can be used to trigger arbitrary code execution 
(better yet, just don’t use those serializers). For inspiration, 
https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/Forshaw/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf 
introduced this class of issue and 
https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2025/DEF%20CON%2025%20presentations/DEFCON-25-Alvaro-Munoz-JSON-attacks.pdf 
is a good overview of the current state, including other safe/unsafe serializers. 
We recommend type-limiting serializers, such as DataContractSerializer, 
XmlSerializer, and JSON.Net (with TypeNameHandling set to None).
